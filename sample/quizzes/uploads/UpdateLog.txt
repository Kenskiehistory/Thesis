SnapKey Update Log
------------------------
1.1.4 - 25/07/2024

Sticky Keys:
- Introducing Sticky Keys, a feature that remembers the pressed state of the initially held button even after pressing another button.
- For example, if you hold down a directional key like "A" and repeatedly tap the "D" key, each press of "D" will cancel "A" until "D" is released, and vice versa.

Special thanks to @minteeaa for making this possible.

Config:
- Added more characters to the ASCII Code List.
- Slightly adjusted the CFG file to enhance readability.

1.1.3 - 24/07/2024 

Key Bindings:
- Introducing customizable key bindings to accommodate various keyboard layouts such as AZERTY (where A=Q, D=D). You can now modify the keys managed by SnapKey by editing the config.cfg file using the ASCII Code List.

Others:
